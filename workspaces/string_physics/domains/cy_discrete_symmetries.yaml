  Discrete symmetries arising from Calabi-Yau geometry and their physical
  implications: automorphism groups of CY3 manifolds acting on Hodge structure,
  dihedral/non-Abelian flavor symmetries for Yukawa textures, Froggatt-Nielsen
  U(1) from geometry, D-brane orientifold discrete remnants, geometric
  engineering of flavor symmetries, and the relationship between CY
  monodromy groups and neutrino mixing patterns.

domain_context: >
  Central object: The GL=12/D₆ polytope — h¹¹=17, h²¹=20, KS index 37.
  A D₆ dihedral symmetry acts on the 20 complex-structure moduli, reducing
  them to 5 D₆-invariant combinations. The holomorphic (3,0)-form Ω transforms
  under D₆, so only D₆-invariant periods enter the superpotential.

  26 D₆-invariant Yukawa couplings survive (out of the full set), creating a
  highly constrained Yukawa texture. Open question: do these 26 couplings
  reproduce a realistic quark-lepton mass hierarchy, or do we need a
  secondary Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism?

  The CyTools pipeline computes these via:
    κ_{abc} = ∫ J_a ∧ J_b ∧ J_c  (Kähler triple intersection)
    Y_{ijk} ∝ ∫_CY3 Ω ∧ χ_i ∧ χ_j ∧ χ_k  (from (2,1)-forms)

  Key questions:
  - Which CY3 automorphism groups can sustain non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetry?
  - How does the D₆ action constrain the Picard-Fuchs system?
  - Can CY monodromy groups predict θ₁₃ lepton mixing angles?
