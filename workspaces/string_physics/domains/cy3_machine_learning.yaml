description: >
  Machine learning approaches to Calabi-Yau threefold geometry: predicting
  line bundle cohomology, Hodge numbers from polytope data, learning
  topological invariants, neural network approximation of period integrals
  and Yukawa couplings, generative models for vacua scanning, reinforcement
  learning for bundle construction, and ML-accelerated Kreuzer-Skarke
  database exploration.

domain_context: >
  This domain sits at the intersection of algebraic geometry, string
  compactification, and machine learning. The central objects are Calabi-Yau
  threefolds (CY3s) constructed as hypersurfaces in toric varieties defined
  by reflexive polytopes from the Kreuzer-Skarke (KS) database.

  Key prediction targets:
  - h⁰(L): number of global sections of a line bundle L on a CY3 — this
    determines the number of matter generations in heterotic string theory
  - Hodge numbers (h¹¹, h²¹): topological invariants controlling the number
    of Kähler and complex-structure moduli
  - Line bundle cohomology vector (h⁰, h¹, h², h³): full deformation theory
  - Swiss cheese parameters (τ/V^{2/3}): LVS moduli stabilization viability
  - Elliptic / K3 fibration existence: F-theory compactification pathways

  Key input features for ML models:
  - Reflexive polytope vertex matrix and face lattice
  - Dual polytope structure
  - Mori cone generators and SR ideal
  - Intersection numbers κ_{abc}
  - Second Chern class c₂
  - GLSM charge matrix
  - Line bundle charge vector (integers relative to Kähler basis)

  Key methods in the literature:
  - Supervised regression/classification (random forest, XGBoost, MLP)
  - Graph neural networks on toric divisor graphs
  - Transformer architectures on polytope sequences
  - Topological data analysis (persistent homology of polytope fan)
  - Reinforcement learning for sequential bundle construction
  - Normalizing flows / VAEs for generative modelling of the landscape

  Open problem (from companion CyTools scan project):
  The KS database has 104 Hodge pairs with χ = −6 (three-generation CY3s),
  ranging h¹¹ = 13 to 128. ~50,000 polytopes have been scanned but 195,000+
  remain at h¹¹ = 18 alone. A validated ML pre-screener (predict h⁰ ≥ 3
  line bundle existence from cheap polytope combinatorics) could give 100×
  speedup. The hypothesis: normalized lattice point density, Gorenstein index,
  and face lattice depth jointly predict h¹¹ and line bundle richness.
