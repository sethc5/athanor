# Athanor Meta — AI-assisted scientific discovery (dogfood domain)
# Athanor analysing itself and related systems. The gaps it finds here
# are candidates for its own roadmap.

display: "AI-Assisted Scientific Discovery"
description: >
  AI systems for scientific discovery: knowledge graph construction,
  automated hypothesis generation, LLM reasoning over literature,
  and the limits of current approaches. Running athanor on this domain
  surfaces its own blind spots and improvement opportunities.

domain_context: >
  This domain covers AI and ML systems applied to scientific research.
  Prefer precise technical terms over marketing language.
  Key distinctions to preserve:
  - knowledge graph vs. embedding space vs. citation network
  - retrieval vs. reasoning vs. generation
  - structural gap (graph topology) vs. semantic gap (embedding distance)
  - hypothesis (testable prediction) vs. research question vs. observation
  Relations: extracts_from, indexes, retrieves, embeds, ranks, scores,
  clusters, bridges, contradicts, extends, validates, refutes.
  Flag when a result is: benchmark-only, domain-specific, human-evaluated,
  or requires proprietary data. Note differences between closed-loop
  (automated end-to-end) vs. human-in-the-loop systems.
