  Moduli stabilization mechanisms in IIB string compactifications — KKLT,
  Large Volume Scenario (LVS), flux compactification, Picard-Fuchs differential
  systems for CY period integrals, GKZ hypergeometric systems, Yukawa coupling
  computation from geometry, de Sitter uplift conjectures, and the causal
  constraints that complex-structure moduli stabilization imposes on Kähler
  moduli through the special geometry relations.

domain_context: >
  This domain covers the mathematics and physics of period integrals and
  moduli stabilization for type IIB string compactifications on CY3 × ℝ^{3,1}.
  The central objects are:

  Period integrals Π_a(z) = ∫_{γ_a} Ω(z) where Ω(z) is the holomorphic
  (3,0)-form on the CY3 and z = (z_1,...,z_{h^{2,1}}) are complex-structure
  moduli. These satisfy the Picard-Fuchs (PF) differential system L_i Π = 0
  where L_i are GKZ differential operators determined by the lattice of the
  toric ambient space (GLSM charge matrix).

  Key results needed for realistic models:
  - Closed-form or numerical period integrals near large complex-structure and
    conifold points
  - Flux superpotential W = ∫(G_3 ∧ Ω) = G_a Π^a + F_a ∂W/∂τ^a (Gukov-Vafa)
  - Kähler potential K = -ln(-i∫(Ω∧Ω̄)) - 2ln(V) (Kähler + dilaton)
  - KKLT: W_0 = const from flux stabilization, then non-perturbative W_np
    from gaugino condensation / D3-instantons. Requires |W_0| << 1.
  - LVS: Require h¹¹ ≥ 2, at least one "Swiss cheese" small cycle (dP divisor
    with D³ > 0 and τ_s = D_s²). Exponentially large volume V ~ e^{a τ_s}.
    Hierarchy: V ~ e^{a τ_s} >> 1, τ_s ~ ln(V)/a, W_0 ~ O(1).
  - de Sitter: Anti-D3 brane uplift (KKLT), D-term uplift, F-term uplift.
    All contested — Maldacena-Nunez argument, Danielsson-Van Riet criticism.

  Special geometry relations:
  F_{abc} = κ_{abc} (intersection numbers at large volume)
  K_{ij̄} (Kähler metric) = ∂_i ∂_{j̄} K
  Complex structure → Kähler back-reaction via mirror map:
  t^a = ∂F/∂X^a (periods determine Kähler coordinates on mirror)

  GL=12 / D₆ context (primary application):
  The polytope h¹¹=17, h²¹=20, D₆ symmetry (index 37 in KS) has 5
  D₆-invariant complex-structure moduli, exactly making the PF system
  tractable (20 → 5 via symmetry reduction). 26 D₆-invariant Yukawa
  couplings known. GKZ system being analyzed. Goal: closed-form periods
  → exact Yukawa texture prediction at stabilization locus.

  Key conjectures / open questions:
  - Does complex-structure stabilization causally constrain the Kähler moduli
    subspace? (Equivalently: does ∂²W/∂z_i∂z_j determine K_{ab} on the
    Kähler side via the mirror map?)
  - Swampland de Sitter conjecture: |∇V| ≥ c·V excludes metastable dS vacua.
    Status: debated. Compatible with LVS? KKLT?
  - Tadpole conjecture: flux tadpole N_flux ≤ 2/3 h_{2,1}. Rules out many
    KKLT constructions. Tested computationally?
