  ## CyTools GL=12 / D₆ Polytope — Discrete Symmetry Research Context

  This domain targets external literature on discrete symmetry in Calabi-Yau
  compactifications, with direct relevance to the GL=12 polytope (h¹¹=17,
  h²¹=20) identified in the CyTools 3-generation scan.

  ### The GL=12 Polytope — D₆ Symmetry Facts
  - Gorenstein index 12, point group D₆ (dihedral of order 12 ≅ Z₂ ⋊ Z₆)
  - Largest discrete symmetry group among ALL χ=±6 reflexive polytopes in KS
  - 5 D₆-invariant Kähler moduli τ₁…τ₅ (of 17 total)
  - 5 D₆-invariant complex structure moduli (of 20 total)
  - 26 D₆-invariant Yukawa couplings from the 3-family intersection structure
  - Maximal τ_Swiss ≈ 8.3 → viable large-volume string background
  - 14 divisor classes, 3 of which are del Pezzo (dP) → non-perturbative
    instanton contributions to Yukawa are geometrically accessible

  ### Open Problem P2 — Yukawa Texture from D₆ Symmetry
  The 26 D₆-invariant Yukawa couplings W_{ijk} = ∫ Ω ∧ ψᵢ ∧ ψⱼ ∧ ψₖ
  decompose under D₆ representations. If the D₆ acts faithfully on the
  three generations (≅ flavor symmetry), it predicts:
  - Zero entries in the Yukawa matrix by group theory
  - Ratios of nonzero entries fixed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
  - Comparison to observed quark/lepton mass hierarchies + CKM/PMNS angles

  ### Why Discrete Symmetry Matters for the Standard Model
  - The observed fermion mass hierarchy (top vs. electron: factor 10⁵) is
    unexplained in the SM — discrete symmetry groups like A₄, S₄, D₆, Δ(27)
    are leading candidates for flavor symmetry explaining this
  - CY orbifold quotients by Γ ⊂ SU(3) produce discrete torsion → shifts
    the Yukawa selection rules (discrete torsion H ∈ H²(Γ, U(1)))
  - Non-perturbative Yukawa from D3/E3-instantons wrapping dP divisors can
    fill entries forbidden at perturbative level — dP divisors in GL=12
    provide exactly this mechanism

  ### Phenomenological Targets
  - Does D₆ acting on three generations reproduce observed mass ratios?
  - Which Standard Model group embeddings (SU(5), SO(10), Pati-Salam)
    are compatible with D₆ symmetry breaking via flux/vev?
  - Can anomalous U(1)_B-L from the CY cohomology suppress proton decay?
  - Do non-perturbative corrections (E3 on dP divisors) generate μ-term
    or neutrino Dirac mass without destabilizing LVS moduli?

  ### Research Frontier
  - Systematic classification of discrete symmetries in KS polytopes is
    incomplete — only a handful of GL≥8 cases have been analyzed
  - Connection between polytope automorphism group and physical flavor
    symmetry is conjectural for h¹¹>6 cases
  - F-theory spectral cover can break GUT → SM while preserving discrete
    subgroup — mechanism not fully worked out for D₆ case
  - Swampland cobordism conjecture may restrict consistent discrete symmetries
    in quantum gravity — relevance to D₆ unknown
