  What discriminates a Calabi-Yau compactification that merely contains
  SU(3)×SU(2) gauge factors from one that actually IS the Standard Model?
  Filtering criteria beyond Kodaira fiber classification: chirality conditions,
  Yukawa rank/texture, hypercharge flux breaking, proton decay suppression,
  moduli stabilization compatibility, and the structural question of whether
  χ(CY3) = ±6 with elliptic fibration inherently forces SM-like gauge algebras.

  ## Motivating Observation

  In a CyTools scan of χ = -6 reflexive polytopes from the Kreuzer-Skarke
  database, ALL 39 elliptically fibered CY3 threefolds examined carry gauge
  algebras containing su(3) ⊕ su(2) ⊕ u(1) factors from Kodaira fiber
  classification. This is either:

  (A) A deep structural fact: χ = -6 + elliptic fibration may inherently
      force SM-like gauge algebras (publishable if true).
  (B) An artifact of the heuristic Kodaira classifier being too permissive.

  If (A), the real question shifts from "which CY3s have SM gauge groups?"
  to "which ones are the *actual* SM?" — requiring sharper discriminants.

  ## The Filtering Hierarchy (what we need to understand)

  Level 0: Gauge algebra contains su(3) ⊕ su(2)  ← DONE (trivially: 39/39)
  Level 1: Correct hypercharge U(1)_Y embedding   ← How restrictive?
  Level 2: Exactly 3 chiral generations            ← χ/2 = 3, but chirality
           index ≠ net chirality without flux choice
  Level 3: Yukawa couplings exist AND have correct  ← Rank conditions,
           rank structure (top ≫ bottom ≫ electron)    texture zeros
  Level 4: No fast proton decay (B-L or discrete    ← Anomalous U(1),
           symmetry protection)                        discrete remnants
  Level 5: Moduli stabilization (LVS/KKLT) compatible ← Swiss cheese
           with Yukawa sector                           structure needed
  Level 6: Cosmological viability (dS vacuum,       ← Swampland constraints
           inflation, dark energy)

  ## Key Research Groups & Their Approaches

  - Anderson/Gray/Lukas: heterotic line-bundle models on CICYs, systematic
    scan of ~10⁸ bundles, chirality from Chern classes, stability from
    slope conditions. Their filtering power at each level is well-documented.

  - Cvetic/Halverson/Lin: F-theory on toric bases, Weierstrass models,
    systematic classification of gauge algebras from discriminant locus.
    Key question: what fraction of their "SM-like" models survive Yukawa
    and proton-decay filters?

  - Braun/He/Ovrut: heterotic spectral cover on favorable CY3s, SU(5) → SM
    via Wilson lines. Key result: only O(100) models survive all filters
    out of O(10⁵) candidates. What are their decisive filters?

  - Taylor/Wang: F-theory base classification, toric bases for 4D F-theory,
    counting elliptic fibrations. Upper bounds on gauge group rank.

  - He/Lukas/ML: machine learning for Hodge number prediction, bundle
    stability, SM identification. What features are predictive?

  ## Open Questions for Athanor

  1. Does χ = -6 force certain Kodaira fiber types? (If yes, Level 0 is
     trivial and we can skip it entirely.)

  2. What is the theoretical filtering power of each level? (i.e., what
     fraction of candidates does each test eliminate?)

  3. Is there a lattice-level obstruction to SU(5) GUT → SM breaking that
     would re-rank candidates without explicit flux computation?

  4. For the GL=12/D₆ polytope (h¹¹=17, h²¹=20): which of Levels 1-6
     have been checked, and which remain open?

  5. Can topological invariants alone (without explicit metric or flux
     computation) discriminate real SM vacua?
