      "mechanism": "Orientifold involutions act on H²'¹(CY₃) via a grade-2 Hodge structure reduction that shrinks the real dimension of the moduli space and simultaneously alters the multiplicity structure of period integrals near singular loci. Involutions with high symmetry preserve larger subspaces of periods, forcing them to satisfy redundant monodromic constraints that eliminate the flux degrees of freedom needed to reach small W₀. Conversely, low-symmetry involutions break these redundancies, allowing flux vectors to probe the full superpotential landscape and locate critical points at W₀ ≪ 1.

      "statement": "We hypothesize that the principal-part algebraic structure and characteristic variety of a GKZ operator system uniquely determine the toric lattice polytope (and hence the ambient GLSM charge matrix) via a computable inverse functor, enabling reconstruction of the full Picard-Fuchs ideal without explicit charge-matrix input.",
      "mechanism": "GKZ operators are homogeneous differential operators whose principal symbols encode the combinatorial geometry of a toric polytope via their singular loci (characteristic variety). The principal part—the highest-degree terms in the operator ideal—carries information about the lattice polytope's vertices, edges, and normal fans via the correspondence between D-modules and toric varieties. Inverting this correspondence via Gröbner basis methods applied to the characteristic variety and using lattice-point enumeration from the singularity structure allows recovery of the ambient polytope and charge matrix.",
      "prediction": "For a GKZ system of rank r acting on h^{1,1}-dimensional periods, the principal parts and characteristic variety will uniquely recover ≥95% of the charge-matrix rows (within lattice isomorphism) and ≥90% of the polytope vertices, as validated against 10 published CY3 examples, without requiring the original toric data as input.",
      "falsifiable": true,
      "falsification_criteria": "If the reconstructed charge matrix (from principal-part inversion) differs from the true charge matrix in rank, or if the reconstructed polytope vertices fail to generate the correct intersection numbers κ_{ijk} when compared to known Yukawa couplings, with error >5% in any single coupling, the hypothesis is refuted.",

After computational validation: (1) Prove the inversion functor formally as an equivalence of categories (D-modules with GKZ structure ↔ toric lattices with charge-matrix data), or identify the obstruction class. (2) Extend the method to Calabi-Yau complete intersections in toric varieties (not just ambient CY3), where the charge matrix is not square. (3) Test the method on examples with non-isolated singularities and verify robustness. (4) Apply the reconstructed Picard-Fuchs systems to actual moduli stabilization: compute flux superpotential W and Kähler potential K for a new unexplored CY3 (predicted from principal parts alone), then use the Swampland de Sitter conjecture to rule in/out dS uplift; compare against a wet-lab-like KKLT/LVS construction study to verify predictive power. This last step would require numerical integration of periods near stabilization loci and monodromies, confirming that principal-part inversion alone yields physically consistent Yukawa textures."
