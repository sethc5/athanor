For elliptic fibrations over toric bases, the Kodaira fiber classification constrains the moduli-stabilization scales (m_stab ∝ exp(−aV) in KKLT/LVS). A CY3 with χ = −6 paired with specific Kodaira types produces Kähler metrics with restricted rank in the mixed Higgs-moduli sector, forcing second derivatives at saddle points to be small. This causes barriers to be broad and shallow, with height V_barrier much less than m_stab.

This rigidity constraint propagates to the elliptic fibration: it forces monodromy representations with restricted conjugacy classes in Sp(2g, ℤ) (where g is the genus of the spectral curve). Restricted monodromy eliminates certain Kodaira fiber degeneration patterns, which in turn limits admissible flux quantum numbers. Non-exact strong fillings tolerate broader monodromy freedom, leading to larger flux lattices and higher likelihood of incompatible chirality indices or Yukawa textures.

      "statement": "We hypothesize that SM-viable 4D F-theory models are constrained to a discrete, topologically-characterized subset of elliptic fibrations characterized by: (1) specific Kodaira fiber types forced by χ = -6, (2) hypercharge U(1)_Y embeddability within the discriminant lattice, and (3) Yukawa rank structure determinable from toric intersection theory alone—and that filtering by Levels 1–3 (hypercharge, chirality, Yukawa rank) predicts Level 5–6 viability (moduli stabilization, cosmology) with >75% precision without explicit metric or flux computation.",
      "mechanism": "The filtering hierarchy operates as a causal cascade: topological constraints (χ = -6, Kodaira fiber types) determine the available gauge algebras and their embeddings; correct hypercharge embedding then restricts the allowed U(1) lattice; chirality index and Yukawa rank structure follow from the spectral cover geometry and toric divisor intersection matrix. These levels are NOT independent filters applied sequentially: Level 1–3 constraints propagate backward to restrict the fiber configurations that admit them, and forward to constrain the moduli space geometry (Level 5) and swampland bounds (Level 6). If SM viability has a topological bottleneck, then early-stage geometric filters should be predictive of late-stage phenomenological survival.",

(iii) Of those 4–8, a machine-learning classifier trained on Levels 1–3 topological invariants (Kodaira types, hypercharge lattice properties, intersection numbers) will predict Level 5–6 survival (moduli stabilization + cosmological viability) with F₁-score ≥ 0.75 on a held-out test set of heterotic line-bundle and F-theory models from the literature.",
