      "research_question": "Can diagnostic assistance frameworks from clinical AI—specifically uncertainty quantification, explainability, and human-in-the-loop validation—be systematically transferred to automated hypothesis generation and validation in mathematical physics discovery systems, and what mechanical analogues exist between disease classification and topological invariant prediction?",
      "why_unexplored": "Clinical diagnosis and mathematical physics discovery operate in seemingly incommensurable domains: one involves noisy empirical data and probabilistic reasoning about biological systems; the other involves symbolic structures and deterministic mathematics. The literature treats AI-assisted medical diagnosis and AI-accelerated mathematical discovery as separate methodological silos, despite both requiring systems to (1) ingest high-dimensional structured data, (2) propose candidate solutions under uncertainty, and (3) provide human-interpretable reasoning. The bridge remains unexplored because domain scientists in each field have not recognized that their validation bottlenecks are structurally homologous.",
      "intersection_opportunity": "Diagnostic assistance systems have developed mature patterns for handling uncertainty, false-positive suppression, and clinician trust-building that could directly improve automated hypothesis generation in mathematical discovery. Conversely, the symbolic and deductive nature of mathematical discovery could provide diagnostic systems with stronger formal guarantees. Specifically: (a) uncertainty-aware ranking of candidate Hodge numbers or line bundle cohomology predictions could be enhanced using Bayesian diagnostic frameworks; (b) automated Calabi-Yau vacua generation could incorporate diagnostic-style human-in-the-loop filtering, reducing false physical vacua; (c) knowledge graph construction for mathematical physics could adopt diagnostic probability calibration methods to distinguish high-confidence structural links from spurious correlations.",
      "methodology": "1. Formalize the structural homology: map the clinical diagnostic pipeline (symptom→test→candidate diagnosis→confidence→clinician decision) onto the mathematical discovery pipeline (geometric constraint→computed invariant→hypothesis proposal→confidence→mathematician validation), identifying where uncertainty enters each. 2. Extract diagnostic assistance principles from clinical AI literature (Bayesian networks, calibration metrics, explainability via attention/saliency) and instantiate them in a Calabi-Yau prediction task: train a cohomology predictor with explicit uncertainty bounds and compare false-positive suppression against baseline. 3. Implement a human-in-the-loop loop for vacua filtering: present generated geometries ranked by diagnostic-style confidence, measure mathematician acceptance rates and reasoning patterns. 4. Validate transfer: benchmark whether clinical calibration metrics (Brier score, ECE) improve mathematical discovery system reliability as measured by downstream physics consistency checks.",
