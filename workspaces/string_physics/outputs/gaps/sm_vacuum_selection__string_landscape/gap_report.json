The two fields use 'metastable' in technically similar but operationally disconnected ways: one emphasizes barrier topology in high-dimensional moduli spaces; the other, tunneling rates in quantum field theory potentials.",
      "intersection_opportunity": "Developing a unified decay-rate formalism for string compactification moduli spaces would enable: (1) systematic ranking of SM-like candidates by vacuum lifetime, eliminating geometrically realizable but phenomenologically doomed vacua; (2) reverse-engineering: using swampland constraints on decay modes to narrow the space of viable CY geometries and bundle structures; (3) identifying whether the Kahler moduli potential in flux-stabilized geometries exhibits universal features (e.g., nearby-saddle degeneracies, exponential suppression of certain tunneling channels) that favor long-lived electroweak vacua by geometric accident rather than design.",
      "methodology": "(1) Map explicit examples from the Kreuzer-Skarke database: select 5–10 CY3-fibrations with Kodaira fiber types permitting SU(3)×SU(2) factors; construct their Kahler and superpotential at leading flux-stabilization order. (2) Numerically compute the moduli-space potential Landscape using established CY metrics (Weil-Petersson or numerical PDE solvers); identify local minima compatible with SM gauge algebra and chirality constraints. (3) For each candidate, calculate the tunneling exponent S_B using the thin-wall or bounce formalism adapted to moduli space geometry; extract lifetime τ ~ exp(S_B) in Planck units. (4) Cross-validate decay channels: does the geometry permit rapid transitions to other CY topologies or unbounded moduli excursions? (5) Correlate decay suppression with geometric invariants (χ(CY3), Hodge numbers, Calabi-Yau discriminant structure) to identify predictive patterns.",
