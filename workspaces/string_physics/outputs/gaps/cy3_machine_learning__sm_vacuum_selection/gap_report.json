Bundle-construction RL focuses on maximizing geometric properties (Chern class consistency, coherence), while SM-selection work relies on post-hoc filtering of candidate geometries. The gap reflects a failure to treat phenomenological constraints as *dynamic reward signals* during the construction phase rather than as downstream rejection criteria, and a lack of explicit architectural coupling between geometry-learning agents and physics-constraint solvers.",
