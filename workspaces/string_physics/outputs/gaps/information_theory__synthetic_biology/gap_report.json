Test on canonical models: repressilator circuits, bistable switches, and resource-sharing networks with synthetic data and published experimental datasets (e.g., from Geva-Zatorsky et al., Nature 2006; Elowitz & Leibler, Nature 2000). 4. Develop sufficient-statistic discovery algorithms: use automatic differentiation to compute information-geometric projections onto lower-dimensional sufficient subspaces, and validate that projections preserve posterior predictive distributions. 5.
