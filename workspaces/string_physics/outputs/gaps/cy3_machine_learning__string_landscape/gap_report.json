      "why_unexplored": "ML practitioners focus on numerical topological invariants (Hodge numbers, Chern classes) while string theorists use stacks to track automorphisms and quotient singularities in bundle moduli, but these communities have not formalized how automorphism-tracking (stack structure) should constrain learned representations. The barrier is technical: stacks are abstract category-theoretic objects, while ML operates on point clouds and graph embeddings; bridging them requires concrete algebraic-geometric encoding into neural architectures.",
      "intersection_opportunity": "Explicitly encoding stack structure into equivariant neural networks would create learners that respect vector bundle automorphism groups *during training*, not post-hoc. This could yield models that automatically preserve the quotient singularities and identification patterns in F-theory moduli, reducing spurious solutions in vacua scans and enabling learned Gromov-Witten invariants and period integrals that respect the full groupoid geometry of the compactification.",
      "methodology": "1. Formalize the stack of SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) bundles over a fixed CY3 as a colimit of representable functors; encode the stabiliser subgroups explicitly. 2. Design an equivariant message-passing graph neural network where node features are sections of vector bundles and edge updates respect the action of the structure group; ensure the learned embedding is a *principal bundle* over the moduli space, not just a vector space. 3. Train on Kreuzer-Skarke data, verifying that learned Hodge numbers and periods preserve automorphism orbits (i.e., isomorphic bundles map to equivalent representations under the groupoid action). 4. Compare against standard (non-equivariant) learners on held-out vacua: check whether stack-aware models reduce false positives in moduli stabilisation and improve generalisation to new polytopes. 5. Validate against known F-theory anomaly constraints and discriminant loci.",

Second, encode spectral data as fixed-dimensional numerical vectors via persistence-topological features, spectral moments, or learned embeddings. Third, train supervised ML models (random forests, neural networks, transformers) to predict h^0, h^1, h^2 cohomology groups and chiral generation counts from these embeddings on held-out test bundles. Fourth, validate predictions against exact algebraic computation and measure whether spectral encoding captures geometric constraints (slope stability) implicitly.

      "why_unexplored": "ML work on Calabi-Yau geometry has focused on predicting intrinsic topological/geometric invariants (Hodge numbers, cohomology) rather than embedding physics constraints into the learning objective. Conversely, string landscape model-building relies on combinatorial enumeration and ad-hoc filtering, rarely leveraging learned representations or inductive biases from the physics of moduli stabilization. The two communities use incompatible abstractions: ML treats CY3s as pure geometric objects; model-builders treat them as phenomenological templates. This conceptual decoupling has prevented feedback between learning algorithms and the physics constraints that define viable models.",
      "intersection_opportunity": "A physics-informed ML framework could embed F-theory discriminant structure, moduli stabilization requirements, and swampland conjectures directly into neural network loss functions and generative model priors, enabling: (1) learned filters that reject geometrically inconsistent or unstable compactifications before expensive bundle construction; (2) generative models that preferentially sample from the tiny phenomenologically viable subset of the landscape; (3) transfer learning from solved low-generation models to seed searches for chiral three-generation solutions. This would transform landscape search from brute-force enumeration into guided exploration.",

(2) Build a conditional generative model (VAE or diffusion) on the Kreuzer-Skarke database, sampling from the learned posterior over geometries given physics constraints (e.g., 'CY3 that admits SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) bundle with 3 generations'). (3) Validate by benchmarking discovery rates: compare time-to-solution for known SM-like compactifications using physics-informed vs. baseline ML sampling.

The two literatures operate in separate venues with different mathematical vocabularies—one emphasizing dendrograms and clustering, the other emphasizing discriminant geometry and moduli bounds.",

Perform hierarchical clustering (Ward linkage or spectral clustering) on this feature space and extract level-function assignments at multiple cut heights. 3. For each manifold, compute or retrieve ground-truth height (via discriminant Δ or existing tables in arXiv:1602.06303 and related work). 4. Perform regression and information-theoretic tests: does level assignment predict height class (low/medium/high) better than random; does mutual information between level and height exceed baseline? 5.

Benchmark on Kreuzer-Skarke: train on ≤50% of polytopes with known cohomology, test whether learned representations on held-out geometries preserve the Z-module structure of H^*(X). 4.
