      "research_question": "How can formal validity frameworks from metrology and measurement theory constrain the hypothesis validation pipelines in AI-assisted discovery systems, particularly when those systems generate and test conjectures about string theory landscape constraints such as SM-like CY3 compactifications?",
      "why_unexplored": "Hypothesis validation in AI discovery literature focuses on logical consistency, empirical match, and reproducibility—but rarely formalizes what validity means in the metrological sense: whether extracted features actually measure underlying physical structure versus artifacts of the search procedure. In string theory vacuum selection, symmetries and topological constraints are treated as hard constraints, not quantities whose validity under model misspecification must be audited. The two communities use validation idiomatically but never meet on the formal question: given an AI system proposes a CY3 compactification as SM-like, by what validity standard do we trust its gauge-theoretic and chirality claims measure real mathematical structure versus latent-space artifacts?",
      "intersection_opportunity": "A bridging framework could operationalize validity-of-discovery-output by requiring AI systems to emit structured validity audits alongside hypotheses: sensitivity analysis under embedding perturbations, construct validity via independent downstream tests (moduli stabilization, proton decay constraints), and criterion validity across out-of-distribution compactifications. This yields validity-aware hypothesis generators for string phenomenology and a reusable validation framework for AI in high-dimensional inverse problems.",
      "methodology": "Implement three-stage audit pipeline: (1) Train LLM plus knowledge-graph system to extract CY3 compactification candidates from literature and generate novel candidates via constraint satisfaction, annotating each with confidence distribution over SM-ness. (2) For sampled candidates, compute formal validity metrics: Jaccard stability under embedding perturbations, cross-validation on held-out literature, moduli-stability consistency via symbolic algebraic geometry. (3) Correlate validity metrics with hypothesis acceptance in peer review (citation velocity, replication) to calibrate which validity signals predict real insight versus artifact. Output a validity-taxonomy for landscape search and retrained system demoting high-confidence-but-low-validity candidates.",
