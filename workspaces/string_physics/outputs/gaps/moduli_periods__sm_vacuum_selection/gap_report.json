      "intersection_opportunity": "Reformulating Yau's uniqueness as a functional constraint on the moduli space: for each complex-structure modulus and each allowed Kähler class, there is exactly one metric. This suggests certain (CS modulus, Kähler class) pairs may be incompatible with SM gauge symmetry breaking because induced metric topology or curvature properties clash with required Higgs mechanism or fermion hierarchies. Conversely, SM-like vacua specified via chirality and Yukawa constraints may force the Kähler class into regimes where metric uniqueness imposes additional stabilization costs, dynamically suppressing those vacua.",
      "methodology": "1. Parameterize moduli space explicitly: fix complex structure via Picard-Fuchs system and period integrals, parametrize the Kähler cone. 2. For each (CS, Kähler) point, construct or retrieve the Ricci-flat metric and compute characteristic curvature invariants. 3. For each configuration, compute induced Yukawa couplings and check consistency with SM fermion masses and CKM unitarity. 4. Identify regions admitting both Ricci-flat metrics with suitable geometry AND Standard Model gauge algebras with realistic chirality. 5. Test whether vacua satisfying SM criteria but violating curvature/topology consistency show instability or require fine-tuned stabilization potentials.",
