      "research_question": "Can discrete flavor symmetries arising from CY₃ automorphisms (particularly D₆ symmetries) predict or constrain the CP-violation phase δ_CP and mass hierarchy signatures measurable in long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments?",
      "why_unexplored": "Long-baseline neutrino experiments and CY₃ discrete symmetry literature operate in nearly disjoint communities: neutrino physics focuses on empirical oscillation measurements to extract mixing parameters, while CY discrete symmetries remain largely within string theory/model-building. The conceptual bridge—that geometric symmetries could make testable predictions about neutrino mixing—is rarely formalized because it requires translating CY automorphism constraints into specific predictions for δ_CP and mass-ordering signatures accessible to experiments like DUNE or T2K.",
      "intersection_opportunity": "By embedding D₆-invariant Yukawa textures derived from CY₃ geometry into neutrino mass models, one could generate specific predictions for the leptonic CP phase and mass hierarchy that long-baseline experiments can directly test. This would create a falsifiable link between string-theoretic geometry and high-energy physics data, potentially explaining why certain mixing patterns (e.g., θ₁₃ ≈ 8.5°) appear natural, and providing a target for future precision measurements to either confirm or rule out whole classes of CY₃ compactifications.",
      "methodology": "1) Enumerate all CY₃ polytopes (via CyTools) with non-Abelian discrete symmetry groups containing D₆ as subgroups; compute the full set of D₆-invariant Yukawa couplings and their texture zeros for each. 2) For each texture, extract the resulting neutrino mass matrix in the basis where charged leptons are diagonal; diagonalize to extract predictions for the three mixing angles (θ₁₂, θ₂₃, θ₁₃) and CP phase δ_CP as functions of unknown Froggatt-Nielsen charges. 3) Scan the space of allowed Froggatt-Nielsen hierarchies to determine which CY₃ families can accommodate current PDG values within 1σ. 4) Identify unique signatures—e.g., correlations between δ_CP and mass-ordering—that discriminate between competing CY₃ geometries. 5) Project predictions onto the experimental discovery space of DUNE and T2K to identify benchmark points testable within the next decade.",
