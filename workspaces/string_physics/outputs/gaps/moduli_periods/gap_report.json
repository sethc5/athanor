      "intersection_opportunity": "Rigid CY3 loci represent special geometric limits where complex-structure deformations freeze out entirely. Studying the behavior of period integrals, Picard-Fuchs operators, and the flux superpotential W(z) as h²¹ approaches zero could reveal how flux-induced stabilization equations concentrate into lower-dimensional constraint subspaces, whether rigidity acts as an attractor in the Kähler potential landscape via the mirror map, and whether moduli-stabilization mechanisms approach rigid limits while shedding unstable directions.",
      "methodology": "Construct a one-parameter family of CY3 mirror manifolds interpolating from a rigid member (h²¹=0) to a non-rigid member (h²¹>0). Compute period integrals using mirror symmetry and GKZ hypergeometric functions, tracking derivative vanishing as h²¹ approaches zero. Solve the Picard-Fuchs system numerically at the rigid limit and extract residual modular forms. Compute flux superpotential W(z,G_3) at generic and rigid limits to identify decoupling or singularities in stabilization equations. Use the mirror map z to t to verify whether the Kähler metric exhibits critical behavior as the original CY approaches rigidity.",
