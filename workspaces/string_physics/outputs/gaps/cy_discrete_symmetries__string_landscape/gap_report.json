(2) Map this abstract symmetry data to geometric invariants: express generalized symmetries in terms of the action of the CY automorphism group on the chiral matter curve multiplicities and Yukawa coupling data. (3) Construct explicit F-theory models on K3-fibered CY3s with specified monodromy groups; compute the resulting discrete symmetries from the D-brane world-volume geometry. (4) Cross-reference predictions against known LST dualities (e.g., heterotic/F-theory duality maps) to validate the symmetry correspondence. (5) Use this validated framework to identify rare models in the Kreuzer-Skarke database where geometric flavor symmetries align with LST-mandated generalized symmetries.",
