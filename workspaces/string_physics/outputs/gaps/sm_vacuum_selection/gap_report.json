The literature treats these as independent algebraic frameworks rather than examining whether bialgebra structures on the heterotic bundle moduli space *induce* or *constrain* coalgebraic structures on the effective 4D gauge algebra.

If bialgebra comultiplication on the bundle moduli space projects to coalgebraic comultiplication on the emergent SM gauge algebra, this would provide a topological pre-filter: candidates whose moduli spaces lack appropriate bialgebra structure would be ruled out at Level 0 or 1, eliminating the trivial 39/39 problem.

Use spectral sequences and derived tensor products to characterize the moduli-space algebra. 4) Compare filtering power: measure what fraction of candidates satisfy the bialgebra-coalgebra compatibility condition before explicit flux/chirality computation. 5) Test predictiveness: train on candidates where both structures are explicitly computed; predict coalgebraic structure from bialgebra invariants on unseen polytopes.",
