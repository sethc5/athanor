      "research_question": "Can few-shot learning frameworks trained on miniImageNet-scale polytope datasets enable accurate prediction of Hodge numbers and line bundle cohomology for CY3s with <100 labeled examples per Hodge pair class, and does transfer learning from visual feature spaces to geometric invariants improve sample efficiency?",
      "why_unexplored": "Few-shot learning and miniImageNet benchmarks emerged from computer vision (2018–2020s) while CY3 ML focused on large-scale supervised regression over the 10k+ fully-computed polytope subset. The literature treats polytope prediction as a standard regression problem rather than a data-scarcity problem: no paper has framed the 195k+ unscanned polytopes at h¹¹=18 as a few-shot classification or meta-learning challenge. The semantic overlap is high (both handle limited examples) but operationally disconnected because domain-specific geometric feature engineering (reflexive lattice, Mori cone) developed in parallel to generic few-shot vision benchmarks.",
      "intersection_opportunity": "Reformulating the KS screening task as few-shot meta-learning could unlock two gains: (1) use miniImageNet-inspired episodic training on the 10k labeled polytopes to learn a metric space or task-adaptive embedding where each Hodge pair class is learnable from 5–10 examples, transferring across h¹¹ values; (2) apply prototypical networks or matching networks to rank unlabeled polytopes by uncertainty, prioritizing expensive toric-divisor computations for high-uncertainty candidates. This could accelerate the validation of the lattice-density–Gorenstein-index–h¹¹ hypothesis while reducing computation by orders of magnitude.",
      "methodology": "1. Curate a miniaturized CY3 episode dataset: stratify the 10k labeled polytopes into 30–50 meta-tasks (one per Hodge pair class or h¹¹ bin); for each task, sample 5–10 support examples and 50–100 query examples. 2. Encode each polytope as a fixed-size feature tensor: concatenate normalized vertex matrix, dual polytope invariants (Gorenstein index, face lattice depth, lattice point density), and Mori cone generators; compare against learned embeddings from a GNN on the toric divisor graph. 3. Train meta-learners (Prototypical Networks, Matching Networks, or MAML) on the episodic dataset; evaluate transfer to unseen h¹¹ bins and held-out polytopes. 4. Benchmark against a miniImageNet baseline (standard few-shot CNN adapted to polytope features) and a non-meta baseline (fine-tuning a pre-trained regression model on k examples). 5. On success, apply the trained meta-learner to screen the 195k unlabeled polytopes, ranking by predicted h⁰ ≥ 3 confidence and uncertainty, and validate predictions on a random sample via CyTools computation.",

      "why_unexplored": "The CY3-ML literature has focused on algorithmic advances (graph neural networks, transformers, normalizing flows) and feature engineering rather than hardware deployment. FPGA acceleration papers in the domain (e.g., 2004.02396v1) mention VPEs only in passing as standard building blocks, without investigating whether specialized VPE designs (e.g., fixed-point arithmetic tuned to polytope combinatorics, or tensor cores optimized for sparse Mori cone operations) could unlock orders-of-magnitude speedups. The computational bottleneck of screening 195,000+ remaining polytopes has never been formulated as a hardware-software co-design problem.",
      "intersection_opportunity": "A hardware-aware neural network design pipeline could achieve 100–1000× inference speedup for the KS pre-screener, enabling real-time polytope classification during enumerative searches. By co-optimizing VPE bitwidth (e.g., int8 vs. float32), memory access patterns (exploitation of sparsity in line bundle charge vectors), and parallelism (batch size on Mori cone generators), one could deploy a low-latency, energy-efficient accelerator on modest FPGAs, unlocking large-scale landscape exploration. This bridges hardware engineering and theoretical physics by making previously intractable screening feasible.",
      "methodology": "1) Profile existing trained ML models (RF, XGBoost, MLP on polytope features) to identify the critical path (memory bandwidth, compute ops, precision requirements). 2) Design a custom FPGA VPE datapath optimized for dot products on normalized lattice vectors and face lattice depth features (e.g., low-precision accumulators, pipelined multiply-add units). 3) Implement both a baseline design (standard VPE, float32) and specialized variants (int8/int16, sparsity-aware indexing, batch inference) using HLS or RTL on Xilinx/Intel FPGAs. 4) Benchmark end-to-end latency, throughput, and energy per inference on subsets of the KS database (~1000 polytopes with known h⁰ labels). 5) Validate that predicted line bundle existence (h⁰ ≥ 3) accuracy does not degrade below the software baseline, and quantify speedup and power consumption relative to CPU/GPU baselines.",
