      "methodology": "1. Construct explicit SYZ fibrations for CY3 threefolds with known automorphism groups (e.g., K3-fibered or elliptically-fibered examples). 2. Compute the monodromy representation of π₁(ℂⁿ \\ discriminant) acting on the generic fiber's cohomology, and identify which elements correspond to known discrete flavor symmetries. 3. Compute Picard-Fuchs equations for period integrals along paths in the base space that encircle SYZ singular loci, and verify whether the monodromy-stabilized period vectors match KKLT/LVS constraints. 4. Use mirror symmetry to transport these monodromy constraints from the base geometry back to moduli-space stabilization conditions on the dual. 5. Test predictions against known CY3 examples with engineered flavor symmetries (e.g., those from Weierstrass models with specific singularities).",
