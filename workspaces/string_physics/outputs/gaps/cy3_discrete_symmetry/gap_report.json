      "why_unexplored": "The algebraic geometry community treats very ample vs birationally very ample as a technical distinction about embedding quality, while the string phenomenology community focuses on divisor intersection numbers and cohomology without tracking these finer projective properties. The D₆-invariant divisor classes in GL=12 have been characterized by Kähler moduli counting, but their ampleness hierarchy—which divisors are very ample, which are merely birationally very ample, which fail both—has not been systematically computed. This gap exists because CyTools pipelines prioritize topological data over embedding-theoretic properties.",

Conversely, very ample D₆-invariant divisors provide clean projective embeddings where the discrete symmetry acts linearly, simplifying Yukawa selection rule computations. Characterizing which of the 5 invariant Kähler moduli directions correspond to very ample vs birationally very ample divisors would determine where the discrete symmetry analysis is tractable versus where birational corrections enter.",
