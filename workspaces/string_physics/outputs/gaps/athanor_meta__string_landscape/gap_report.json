      "why_unexplored": "String theory model building has traditionally relied on hand-crafted geometric constructions and anthropic reasoning over the landscape, while particle physics phenomenology is studied via effective field theory independently of string origin. The two communities rarely converge: string theorists lack systematic methods to navigate >10^272 possible compactifications toward experimentally viable sectors, while phenomenologists do not typically constrain their models to string-theoretic origins. AI-assisted discovery has not yet bridged this gap because it requires joint optimization across incommensurable spaces (geometric Calabi-Yau database + particle physics parameter space).",

This would transform model building from exhaustive hand-search into directed exploration of a high-dimensional parameter space, and could identify previously overlooked corners of the landscape where string theory makes testable predictions.",
      "methodology": "First, construct a unified machine-readable representation linking Calabi-Yau geometric invariants (Hodge numbers, Gromov-Witten invariants, periods) to induced gauge groups and matter spectra via heterotic/Type IIA duality and flux quantization rules. Second, train a graph neural network on known string-derived models (e.g., E6 GUT constructions, Pati-Salam models from compactifications in the literature) to learn the manifold of valid (geometry→physics) maps. Third, design a reinforcement learning objective that penalizes deviations from experimental observables (coupling unification, proton decay bounds, neutrino masses) while rewarding geometric consistency. Fourth, search this learned landscape for novel models, validate top candidates through explicit string computation, and test against collider and precision electroweak data. Finally, conduct ablation studies to identify which geometric properties (e.g., Picard rank, singularity structure) most strongly predict Standard Model compatibility.",

Third, develop a constrained optimization framework where the loss function penalizes both prediction error and deviation from landscape-theoretic probability distributions, using empirical sampling or theoretical bounds on the true landscape measure.
