      "why_unexplored": "Particle physics and string model-building are studied as largely separate enterprises: particle physicists work within the Standard Model phenomenology, while string theorists explore the landscape of compactifications independently of real-time feedback from particle physics constraints. The two communities use incompatible formalisms and operate on different timescales. Few existing systems attempt bidirectional coupling between them.",
      "intersection_opportunity": "An AI system could embed particle physics constraints (gauge group structure, fermion hierarchies, anomaly cancellation) as objectives in geometry-search algorithms, accelerating discovery of viable compactifications. Reciprocally, swampland conjectures and moduli stabilisation conditions could be encoded as inductive biases in LLMs, preventing generation of swampland-inconsistent hypotheses that waste experimental attention.",

Train a graph neural network on Calabi-Yau-spectrum pairs to learn which geometric features predict realistic particle physics outcomes.

Test whether AI-guided searches recover known realistic geometries faster than brute-force. Reverse the loop by fine-tuning LLMs on model-building papers, measuring consistency improvements.",

      "why_unexplored": "Particle physics and quantum gravity are traditionally studied in separate epistemic communities: particle physics focuses on the Standard Model as empirically testable, while quantum gravity research (especially string theory) is primarily geometric and formally mathematical. AI-assisted discovery pipelines have not yet encoded the causal feedback loop: particle physics experiments constrain quantum gravity theory, which in turn restricts the viable particle physics models emerging from string compactifications. The string landscape literature treats this as a solved (if unsolved) problem, while AI discovery systems ignore the deep consistency requirements between low-energy effective field theory and ultraviolet completion.",
      "intersection_opportunity": "Building AI systems that explicitly model the bidirectional causal relationship between particle physics constraints and quantum gravity viability could dramatically reduce the search space for realistic string compactifications. Specifically, an automated pipeline could: (1) extract empirical particle physics bounds (mass hierarchies, coupling ratios, CP violation limits) from experimental/observational data; (2) formalize these as constraints on the moduli stabilisation and vector bundle geometry of Calabi-Yau compactifications; (3) use this tight coupling to prune the Kreuzer-Skarke database systematically, focusing on geometries that naturally produce observed particle physics. This would transform string landscape exploration from a brute-force enumeration problem into a physics-informed search.",
      "methodology": "The investigation would proceed in four stages: (1) **Knowledge extraction**: build a structured knowledge graph linking particle physics observables (fermion masses, gauge couplings, neutrino parameters, CP phases) to their quantum gravity origins in string compactification data (Kähler moduli, vector bundle structure groups, flux integers, D-brane wrapping numbers); (2) **Constraint formalization**: encode swampland criteria (distance conjecture, de Sitter swampland conjecture, weak gravity conjecture) and moduli stabilisation requirements as differentiable loss functions in a neural architecture searching over Calabi-Yau topologies; (3) **Empirical constraint injection**: integrate actual particle physics bounds (e.g., from PDG, neutrino oscillation experiments, LHC flavour physics) as hard constraints during Calabi-Yau selection; (4) **Benchmarking**: test whether AI-assisted search (constrained by particle physics + quantum gravity requirements) achieves three-generation, SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) compactifications faster than geometry-only enumeration, and measure the reduction in candidate space. This combines symbolic reasoning (constraint satisfaction), neural search (topology generation), and formal verification (swampland consistency checks).",

      "why_unexplored": "String landscape research has traditionally treated particle physics constraints as post-hoc filters applied after geometric construction, not as generative priors embedded in the search algorithm itself. Conversely, particle physics discovery systems (LLM-based hypothesis generation, knowledge graphs) have not been integrated with the massive geometric databases (Kreuzer-Skarke, F-theory discriminant varieties) that encode string theory solutions. The two communities operate in near-complete informational silos: string theorists view SM recovery as a geometric miracle to be discovered, not predicted; AI researchers treat particle physics as a closed, well-understood domain unsuitable for discovery.",
      "intersection_opportunity": "Build a bidirectional learning system where (1) particle physics constraints (chiral family structure, anomaly cancellation, gauge coupling flows) are encoded as differentiable loss functions guiding geometry exploration in the string landscape, and (2) the geometric structures that *enable* SM recovery (bundle moduli spaces, discriminant locus topology, Yukawa coupling matrices) are fed back as learned inductive biases for more effective physics hypothesis generation.

Develop a graph neural network that jointly embeds Calabi-Yau geometry (Hodge diamond, bundle moduli, discriminant singularity types) and particle physics output spectra. 4. Train a reinforcement learning agent to prioritize geometry mutations (bundle deformations, moduli stabilization paths) that increase likelihood of 3-family SM-like outputs, measured against observables from step 2. 5. Validate on held-out compactifications and quantify improvement in SM-like solution density vs. random sampling or geometric-only optimization.",

      "why_unexplored": "The string landscape community has historically treated the Calabi-Yau solution space as a fixed mathematical object to be surveyed via exhaustive enumeration or Monte Carlo methods, without borrowing techniques from ML for handling severe class imbalance and representation bias. Meanwhile, AI-for-discovery papers focus on balanced datasets as a training hygiene problem, without recognizing that fundamental physics problems (like finding 3-generation models) present inherently imbalanced discovery targets where most geometries yield unphysical results. The two literatures operate in isolation: one optimizes for training stability, the other for exploration efficiency in a pathological landscape.",
      "intersection_opportunity": "Applying answer-distribution balancing techniques (importance weighting, stratified sampling, curriculum learning) to the string compactification search could overcome the bias toward generic, high-moduli-defect solutions and increase the relative frequency of rare but physically viable configurations in iterative discovery pipelines. Conversely, formalizing string landscape sampling as a structured imbalanced-learning problem could provide ML methodology with a challenging, well-defined benchmark for hypothesis generation algorithms that must discover rare high-dimensional targets without supervised labels—a problem type poorly explored in current AI-for-science frameworks.",

Quantify the empirical probability distribution of physically relevant solutions (3-generation index, moduli-stabilisation success, gauge group match) across a stratified subset of 100k+ Kreuzer-Skarke models, establishing baseline rarity. 2. Implement three competing sampling strategies: naive enumeration, inverse-frequency weighting (reweight generations by negative log-probability), and curriculum learning (start on high-generation density regions, progressively explore sparse zones). 3. For each strategy, measure (a) discovery rate of 3-generation models, (b) wall-clock time to first valid configuration, (c) moduli-space coverage uniformity via Wasserstein distance to target distribution. 4. Integrate findings into an LLM-guided search agent that uses answer-distribution feedback to adaptively reweight its hypothesis-generation prior. 5.
