  Engineering of biological systems: genetic circuits, CRISPR-based tools,
  metabolic engineering, cell-free systems, and biosensors. Young enough
  to have real structural gaps; mature enough to have a dense paper base.
  The causal framing athanor uses maps naturally onto regulatory network biology.

domain_context: >
  This is an engineering biology domain. Relations are strongly causal:
  activates, represses, induces, degrades, phosphorylates, transcribes,
  translates, sequesters, gates, filters, amplifies.

  Key distinctions:
  - In vivo (live cells) vs. in vitro (cell-free) vs. in silico (model)
  - Prokaryotic (E. coli, B. subtilis) vs. eukaryotic (yeast, CHO, human)
  - Transcriptional vs. post-transcriptional vs. post-translational regulation
  - Small molecule vs. light vs. temperature induction
  - Characterisation (measured) vs. model (predicted) vs. designed (intended)

  Flag organism context, whether a circuit is orthogonal to the host,
  and whether results are validated in a chassis or only simulated.
