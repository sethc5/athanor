      "why_unexplored": "While electromagnetic field models are standard in wireless communication and random field theory is mature in statistics and physics, the two are rarely integrated in information theory. The separation stems from disciplinary silos: communications engineers use EM fields for design but treat channels as memoryless (ignoring spatial correlation structure), while probabilists study random fields abstractly without grounding them in physical information channels. The causal relationship between EM field structure and information capacity remains implicit rather than formalized.",
      "intersection_opportunity": "Formalizing EM fields as structured random processes could yield new capacity bounds for correlated fading channels, enable principled antenna design by optimizing information flow through spatially-structured fields, and unify the treatment of spatial degrees of freedom in MIMO systems. This would bridge wireless communication engineering with rigorous stochastic process theory, potentially revealing whether existing capacity formulas for spatially-correlated channels are optimal given the underlying EM physics.",
      "methodology": "1) Formalize the mapping: express canonical EM field models (e.g., Rayleigh fading, multipath propagation) as explicit random field representations with their covariance kernels. 2) Compute mutual information I(X;Y) for signal X transmitted through these EM random fields using differential entropy and the Gaussian channel formula adapted to spatially-correlated noise. 3) Compare against existing MIMO capacity literature to identify discrepancies or missed optimization strategies. 4) Develop information-theoretic lower and upper bounds by exploiting spatial correlation structure (e.g., via correlation decay rates, kernel properties). 5) Validate on synthetic and real propagation data (ray-tracing, measured channel sounding).",

The two communities rarely interact because RD theory provides existence proofs (via Shannon's source-coding theorem) but not constructive algorithms, and practical compression work rarely validates against RD bounds or uses RD insights to guide design. This creates a 'theory-practice gap' where RD theory informs bounds but not methods.",

This would unify compression algorithm design under a formal optimization umbrella.",
      "methodology": "Conduct a systematic investigation via: (1) formalize the gap by cataloging which lossy compression algorithms (JPEG, H.264, neural codecs, etc.) actually implement or approximate rate-distortion Lagrangian optimization, versus those using alternative objectives; (2) for a fixed domain (e.g., images with MSE distortion), compute empirical RD curves from literature benchmarks and compare achieved (rate, distortion) pairs against theoretical bounds; (3) design a test case: implement a rate-distortion-aware compressor using iterative Blahut-Arimoto or variational methods, measure whether it outperforms standard lossy codecs on the same data; (4) analyze whether modern learned compression methods (neural codecs) implicitly optimize rate-distortion or pursue different objectives; (5) identify distortion metrics where no practical algorithm achieves known RD bounds and propose new algorithmic approaches.",

The community has treated the field as an external constraint on discrete or quasi-discrete transmitter-receiver pairs rather than asking whether continuous field topology directly encodes information-theoretic limits. This gap persists because bridging requires simultaneous fluency in differential geometry, Maxwell theory, and Shannon-theoretic capacity analysis.",
