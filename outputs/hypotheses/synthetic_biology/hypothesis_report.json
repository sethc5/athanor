      "mechanism": "Sequence-function decoupling is enabled when a biological element's core functional module is structurally insulated from the fitness effects of sequence variation through modular architecture. Elements with low epistasis exhibit fewer deleterious higher-order interactions between amino acid or nucleotide positions, allowing mutations to affect function independently and predictably. Conversely, high-epistasis systems experience context-dependent mutation effects where substitutions at different positions interact nonlinearly, constraining sequence variation to narrow 'functional plateaus' in sequence space. Epistatic load thus causally gates the transition from sequence-coupled to functionally abstracted design.",

(2) Construct the circuit in E. coli or yeast at varying plasmid copy numbers and culture densities. (3) Measure output dynamics using flow cytometry (single-cell) and bulk fluorimetry (population) across scales. (4) Compare experimental outcomes to predictions from the hybrid multiscale model and single-scale baseline. (5) If multiscale model accurately predicts the failure and single-scale model does not, this constitutes direct validation of the framework. Estimated effort: 3–4 months of wet-lab work (construct design, calibration, measurement) plus 1 month of data analysis. This follow-up would definitively establish the practical utility of the framework for synthetic biology design."
