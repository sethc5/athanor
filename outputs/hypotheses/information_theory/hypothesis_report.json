        "expected_negative": "MAPE > 25% or R² < 0.60 across test geometries; geometry-derived bounds fail to track FDTD capacity when conductivity or frequency varies significantly (sensitivity >30% unexplained); optimal geometry does not follow compactness or symmetry principles, indicating geometry alone is insufficient.",
        "null_hypothesis": "H₀: The Shannon capacity of a continuous-region transceiver system is independent of transceiver boundary geometry; capacity is determined solely by frequency-dependent material parameters (permittivity, conductivity, loss) and transmitted power, not by shape or topology. Equivalently, the Green's function spectral properties over geometric domains do not correlate with channel capacity.",
        "statistical_test": "Pearson correlation test (two-sided, α=0.05, n=20 geometries) for r > 0.85; ordinary least squares regression of FDTD capacity vs. geometric predictions, testing H₀: slope ≠ 1 (indicating systematic bias); Bland–Altman analysis for agreement; power set to 0.80 for detecting a 15% MAPE difference from null.",
        "limitations": [
          "Computational FDTD is inherently approximate (finite grid, numerical dispersion, PML truncation); results are subject to discretization error and should be validated against higher-fidelity solvers or experiment.",
          "2D simulations may not capture all 3D field phenomena (e.g., out-of-plane coupling, leaky modes); 3D FDTD becomes computationally expensive (101–102× more cost).",
          "Model assumes linear, time-invariant electromagnetic media; nonlinear saturation, time-varying multipath, or Doppler effects are not captured.",
          "Cross-validation with real antenna arrays is limited to published datasets; direct control of geometry is not possible, reducing validation rigor.",
          "Assumes continuous transceiver regions are stationary and perfectly realized; practical antenna fabrication tolerances and dynamic deformation are not modeled.",
          "Capacity bounds derived from mutual information of received field distributions assume Gaussian input symbols and ideal receiver; practical modulation schemes and imperfect decoding are not considered."
        ],
        "requires_followup": "To fully confirm the hypothesis empirically, a wet-lab experiment would measure the channel capacity of custom-fabricated antenna arrays with controlled geometry (cylindrical, spherical, and irregular shapes of known dimensions) in an anechoic chamber across multiple frequencies (1–10 GHz). This would validate that theoretical predictions translate to real physical systems. Intermediate proxy: simulate realistic antenna impedance (S-parameters, radiation patterns from HFSS) within FDTD and re-validate capacity predictions; this closes the gap between idealized continuous regions and practical discretized antennas without requiring hardware."
