Use numerical algebraic geometry and modular form computations to validate the mirror map.",

          "Step 1: Select a 1-dimensional family of non-Kähler CY threefolds from the literature (e.g., balanced K3 fibrations over ℙ¹, or heterotic duals) parameterized by a metric modulus t ∈ [0, 1] where t=0 is Kähler and t>0 violates the Kähler condition.",
          "Step 2: Verify that the family remains Calabi-Yau (c₁ = 0) throughout by computing the Chern class from balanced metric data using Chern-Simons theory.",
          "Step 3: Compute the Hodge diamond H^{p,q} of the primal space at each t using balanced Dolbeault cohomology (via ∂∂̄-cohomology on the balanced metric).",
          "Step 4: For each point t on the primal family, compute the A-model prepotential F^{(0)}(t) by counting rational curves (genus-0 Gromov-Witten invariants) and instanton corrections using mirror curve techniques (if available) or numerical integration of the Yukawa coupling.",
          "Step 5: Construct a candidate mirror family by generalizing the toric/Dolgachev-Nikulin mirror construction: replace the Kähler modulus space with the balanced moduli space, and build the dual as a variation of complex structure CY threefold whose moduli space dimensions match those of balanced deformations on the primal.",
          "Step 6: For the proposed mirror, compute its period vector Π(s) parameterized by complex structure modulus s, and check if Π(s) ∝ F^{(0)}(t(s)) under a proposed mirror map t ↦ s.",
          "Step 7: Compute D-brane stability conditions (Bridgeland stability or tt∗-equations) on the primal space at several points t, extracting the central charge of simple objects in the derived category.",
          "Step 8: Compute D-brane spectra on the mirror via the same tt∗-framework, applied to the complex structure variations.",
          "Step 9: Compare D-brane spectra numerically: compute the Wasserstein distance or Spearman rank correlation between central charge distributions on primal vs. mirror. If agreement is within ±10%, mark as confirmation.",
          "Step 10: Verify Hodge moduli exchange: count independent balanced metric deformations (orthogonal to Kähler cone) on the primal and compare with dim(H^{2,1}) of the mirror. Compute the percentage overlap.",
          "Step 11: If all checks pass with the above thresholds, the hypothesis is confirmed for this family. If not, identify which mechanism (moduli exchange, prepotential map, or spectrum agreement) fails and propose a refined mirror construction."

For D-brane spectrum KS test: comparing two empirical distributions of ~50 central charges each from primal and mirror computations; with KS statistic threshold at α = 0.05, power ~80% to detect a true 10% shift in the distributions. Hodge moduli counting is deterministic; no power calculation needed, but confidence interval on overlap percentage is ±5% if moduli are counted with uncertainty from numerical rank deficiency.",

          "Limitation 1: The explicit family of non-Kähler CY threefolds available in the literature is limited (mainly balanced K3 fibrations and heterotic constructions); a negative result may reflect lack of suitable test case rather than failure of the mechanism.",
          "Limitation 2: Gromov-Witten invariant computation for non-Kähler spaces is not as mature as for Kähler CY; numerical integration of Yukawa couplings may introduce discretization errors (≤5%), potentially masking modest effect sizes.",
          "Limitation 3: D-brane stability conditions rely on derived-category computations, which for non-Kähler spaces are less rigorously formulated; the tt∗-equations may require ad-hoc adaptations, introducing model-dependence and reducing replicability.",
          "Limitation 4: The mirror construction itself is a hypothesis-driven ansatz (e.g., Dolgachev-Nikulin generalization); if the proposal is incorrect, the test may fail not because mirror symmetry fails, but because the candidate dual is wrong. Multiple mirror proposals may be needed.",
          "Limitation 5: Numerical algebraic geometry is sensitive to precision; period integrals and instanton series convergence require high-precision arithmetic, increasing computational cost and risk of numerical artifacts."
        ],
        "requires_followup": "If computational tests confirm the hypothesis (r ≥ 0.75, D-brane agreement ≥10%, Hodge overlap ≥75%), a wet-lab follow-up would involve: (1) string compactification on an explicit non-Kähler CY threefold (e.g., a heterotic E₈×E₈ dual) and computation of the low-energy effective action (prepotential, gauge coupling); (2) comparison of the effective action with that of a string compactified on the predicted mirror dual, verifying that physical couplings match under the mirror map; (3) experimental/observational tests (if applicable to phenomenology) checking predictions of the non-Kähler compactification against those of its mirror. However, steps (1)–(2) are primarily theoretical/computational; step (3) is speculative and outside current observational reach. The primary computational experiment above is designed to be largely self-contained."
