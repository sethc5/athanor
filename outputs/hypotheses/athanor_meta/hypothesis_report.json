Higher-prestige venues and diverse author affiliations increase the prior probability that a paper appears in recommendation feeds, leading to higher exposure and downstream citations.

Content quality is held constant in this model; the causal effect operates purely through the metadata-mediated visibility pathway, not through changes in what the paper says.",

However, this is impractical for peer-reviewed journals. As a computational proxy, use lagged instrumental variables: construct 'metadata shock' events (e.g., unexpected journal rank changes, author appointment to prestigious institution shortly after paper publication) and test whether pre-publication metadata predicts post-publication citation velocity independent of shocks. If wet-lab analog is needed: conduct a controlled preprint distribution experiment via arXiv API: submit identical papers to arXiv with and without author-diversity cues (e.g., varied institutional affiliations vs. single institution) and measure download/engagement differential over 6 months.

      "mechanism": "Current sequential architectures assume question understanding is logically prior to translation. We propose that formal query structures act as disambiguation signals that retroactively refine semantic parses of ambiguous NL questions. Specifically, when multiple valid semantic interpretations exist (e.g., implicit quantifier scope, prepositional attachment), the constraint that a translation must be formally valid can rule out interpretations that lead to invalid or nonsensical queries, forcing the model to re-weight its candidate parses. This creates a bidirectional loop: understanding informs translation, but translational feasibility constrains understanding. Joint training allows these signals to propagate simultaneously, whereas sequential training locks in understanding errors before translation even begins.",
