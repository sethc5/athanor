This semantic conflation has prevented systematic investigation of how specific efficiency-oriented design choices in the embedding pipeline causally propagate to technique performance. The structural separation suggests different research communities—one focused on algorithmic efficiency, the other on embedding quality metrics—have developed in parallel without explicit mechanistic linking.",

This would bridge systems-level concerns with representation-learning theory.",

Second, select 3-5 representative embedding techniques and implement controlled ablations of embedding process components (e.g., with/without specific optimization steps) on standardized benchmark knowledge graphs, measuring both computational cost (time, memory) and technique performance (link prediction, entity alignment, downstream task accuracy). Third, use causal inference techniques (instrumental variable analysis or do-calculus) to isolate the causal effect of process optimizations on technique outcomes, controlling for confounders (graph size, relation diversity). Finally, validate findings on held-out knowledge graphs from different domains to assess generalizability of causal mechanisms.",
