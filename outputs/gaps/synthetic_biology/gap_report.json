      "why_unexplored": "Systems biology as a methodology and systems biology models as artifacts are typically studied in parallel: modelers develop formal representations in isolation, while experimentalists conduct validation studies that rarely feed back into model architecture. The synthetic biology community treats models as post-hoc validation tools rather than as generative instruments that actively shape experimental design and system exploration. This methodological decoupling persists because the two research communities operate in different venues, use incompatible validation standards, and rarely co-author synthetic biology projects.",

Such tight coupling could dramatically reduce prototyping cycles in synthetic circuit engineering by identifying parameter regimes and interaction topologies that models predict will fail or succeed. This intersection also reveals how computational abstraction level (e.g., ODEs vs. stochastic vs. agent-based) must be co-optimized with experimental readout modality and cell-line choice—currently left implicit.",

Second, select 3–5 canonical synthetic circuits (repressilator, toggle switch, oscillators) and reconstruct their published models, then benchmark model predictions against re-analyzed experimental data from the original papers, stratifying by parameter estimation method. Third, design a prospective study: develop a new synthetic circuit with a systems biology model that explicitly encodes uncertainty, use Bayesian experimental design to prioritize measurements that maximally reduce model uncertainty, execute those experiments, and measure prediction error reduction. Fourth, formalize the feedback loop: define metrics for 'model utility' (e.g., reduction in design iterations, prediction accuracy, parameter identifiability) and test whether tight coupling of modeling and experimentation improves these metrics compared to decoupled workflows.",

The field has historically focused on achieving oscillation at all, and later on frequency tuning, leaving the mechanistic coupling between frequency and amplitude largely implicit in differential equation models rather than explicitly engineered.
