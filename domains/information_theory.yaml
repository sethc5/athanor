# Information Theory — domain config
name: information_theory
display: "Information Theory"
description: >
  Mathematical theory of information transmission, compression, and storage.
  Mature enough to verify pipeline output, open enough to have real gaps.
  Connects to biology, physics, AI, and consciousness research.

domain_context: >
  This is a mathematical/theoretical domain. Prefer precise technical terms
  (e.g. "mutual information", "channel capacity", "Kolmogorov complexity")
  over informal descriptions. Relations should use verbs from the domain
  vocabulary: bounds, achieves, generalizes, reduces_to, quantifies.

# Keywords that signal important concepts in this domain
seed_concepts:
  - entropy
  - mutual information
  - channel capacity
  - rate-distortion theory
  - Kolmogorov complexity
  - Fisher information
  - minimum description length
  - algorithmic information theory
